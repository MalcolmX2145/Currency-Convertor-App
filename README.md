# Currency-Convertor-App
This is my third programming project and my second working with apis.

The web app fetches data from the ExchangeRate-API based on the input the user puts and displays it on the webpage. The output is not accurate because I rounded off the result to 2 decimal places

I was also experimenting with some css styling like the background blur effect with the two opposing colors.

There is a bug that I couldn't fix. It was the reverse button feature where it doesn't reverse the result but duplicates the values. I couldn't figure it outðŸ˜¢.
